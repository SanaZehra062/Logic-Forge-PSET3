# Logic-Forge-PSET3
Solutions for Logic Forge PSET 3. 
<br>
Includes brute-force and optimized implementations

## Overview
This PSET consists of 6 programming challenges.<br>
Each challenge has a dedicated file for its solution.<br>
The challenges focus on logic building, algorithm design, data structures, and problem-solving skills.<br>

## Challenges

1. Smart City Temperature Alerts<br>
   Logic to identify the earliest future day where temperature changes exceed a given threshold.<br>
   Focuses on array traversal, condition checking, and efficient preprocessing for queries.<br>

2. Emergency Evacuation Boats<br>
   Compute the minimum number of boats required under weight and priority constraints.<br>
   Emphasizes greedy strategies, pairing logic, and handling additional evacuation rules.<br>

3. Broadcast Network Feed<br>
   Design a system to manage broadcasts, subscriptions, and personalized feeds.<br>
   Focuses on data structures, ordering rules, priority handling, and efficient retrieval of recent messages.<br>

4. Scrambled Keyword Detection<br>
   Find all positions where an anagram of a given pattern appears in a string.<br>
   Centers on sliding window techniques and character frequency matching.<br>

5. Longest Mirrored Phrase<br>
   Identify the longest palindromic substring within a given string.<br>
   Focuses on string expansion techniques and symmetry-based logic.<br>

6. Suspicious Device Detection<br>
   Detect the identifier that appears exactly n times in a 2n length array.<br>
   Highlights counting logic, hashing, and optimized frequency detection.<br>

## Commit Strategy
Initial brute-force approaches are committed first.<br>
Optimized solutions are committed later.<br>
Commit history demonstrates problem-solving evolution.<br>

## Language

All solutions are implemented in **C++** with clean function decomposition and proper input/output handling.<br>
